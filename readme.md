#sqs-demo

Command line app demonstrating basic SQS capabilities: 
* Send to queue
* Receive from queue
* Delete from queue
* Get queue info

To run this, set up a queue.  Then change the QUEUE_URL constant and run the app.  

Nuget package restore should get the dependencies for you, but if not, check the packages.config to see what you need.
